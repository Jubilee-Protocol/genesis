# Jubilee Protocol

**A strategic L2 that leverages Ethereum as L1 and uses Bitcoin as L3 for permanent data finality.**

### **Our Vision: Unifying Programmability with Permanence**

The digital asset ecosystem is built on two monumental pillars: **Ethereum's** boundless programmability and **Bitcoin's** unmatched, permanent security. Yet, these pillars have remained largely separate, forcing developers and users into a trade-off between dynamic applications and an immutable store of truth.

**Jubilee Protocol is designed to bridge this divide.**

We are building a high-performance, EVM-compatible ZK-Rollup that lives on Ethereum, benefiting from its security and vibrant ecosystem. Our unique feature is a final, archival settlement layer that anchors critical data to the Bitcoin blockchain, creating an unprecedented standard for data permanence.

Our mission is to create a symbiotic platform that offers the best of both worlds: a place for high-speed, sophisticated applications built on a foundation that is both secure and eternally verifiable.

### **The Architecture: A Three-Layer Approach**

Jubilee's structure is hierarchical, with each layer chosen for its greatest strength.

*   **L1: Ethereum (The Security & Settlement Layer)**
    *   Ethereum is the foundation of our security. As a ZK-Rollup, the validity of our entire chain is proven and secured by smart contracts on Ethereum L1. It is the ultimate source of truth for our protocol's state and assets.

*   **L2: Jubilee Protocol (The Execution & Programmability Layer)**
    *   This is where all activity happens. Built on the open-source ZK Stack, our L2 is a fast, low-cost, and EVM-compatible environment where developers can deploy smart contracts and users can interact with dApps seamlessly.

*   **L3: Bitcoin (The Data Finality & Archival Layer)**
    *   This is our unique feature for ultimate permanence. Bitcoin's role is not to secure the L2 (Ethereum does that), but to act as a permanent, immutable "digital notary." Periodically, a cryptographic fingerprint of specific L2 data is embedded onto the Bitcoin blockchain, creating a permanent timestamp that can never be altered or erased.

### **Core Principles**

The development of Jubilee Protocol is guided by a set of foundational principles inspired by the biblical concept of the Year of Jubilee.

*   **Restoration:** Building tools that unlock and restore trapped value across ecosystems.
*   **Stewardship:** Creating a self-sustaining protocol that is governed by its community for long-term health and resilience.
*   **Permanence:** Providing a platform where digital ownership and history can be recorded with integrity and finality.
*   **Openness:** We are committed to building on open-source foundations and contributing our work back to the public good.

### **Current Status & Roadmap**

The Jubilee Protocol is currently in its foundational development phase. Our immediate focus is on building and securing the core components of the protocol.

Our high-level roadmap includes:

1.  **Yoke (Current):** Developing the core bridge contracts, undergoing initial security reviews, and establishing the L2 framework.
2.  **Harvest (Mainnet Launch):** Launching the Jubilee L2, the native token, and core DeFi primitives like staking and a native DEX.
3.  **Wisdom (Economic Activation):** Deploying our unique, yield-generating financial products and activating the protocol's revenue-sharing mechanisms.
4.  **Heritage (Decentralization & Permanence):** Launching the L3 data finality layer and progressively decentralizing the governance and operation of the network to the community.

### **Get Involved**

We are at the beginning of a long and exciting journey to build a more unified, secure, and equitable digital future. While our core development is currently focused, we welcome interest from developers, researchers, and potential partners who are aligned with our vision.

*   **For developers:** Our core contracts and components will be open-sourced as they are completed and audited. 

We believe in building in the open and look forward to sharing more as we reach our next milestones.
